## Key Strengths Observed

### 1. **True Contextual Generation** ✅
- No generic terms like "Component A", "Label 1", "Part X"
- Each SVG uses domain-specific scientific terminology
- Chemistry uses "Kekulé Structure", not "Structure 1"
- Biology uses "Complex I-IV", not "Protein 1-4"
- Computer Science uses "Root Node", "Left Subtree", not "Circle 1", "Circle 2"

### 2. **Educational Quality** ✅
- Average 17.6 labels per SVG (exceeds 5 minimum by 3.5x)
- Test 4 had 33 labels (exceptional detail)
- All labels use scientific names from the domain
- Clear educational value in every visualization

### 3. **Dynamic Animations Where Appropriate** ✅
- Flow animations: 10 in Test 1 (electron transport)
- Pulse animations: 7 in Test 3 (node insertion)
- Orbital animations: 2 in Test 5 (planetary motion)
- Static diagrams: Tests 2 & 4 appropriately have no animation (wave functions and molecular structures)

### 4. **Structural Quality** ✅
- All have proper XML + DOCTYPE declarations
- All use viewBox for scalability
- All have `<style>` sections for clean styling
- 80% use `<defs>` for reusable components
- All use `<g transform>` for organization

### 5. **Domain Diversity** ✅
Successfully generated across 5 completely unrelated fields:
- Cell Biology (mitochondria)
- Quantum Mechanics (wave functions)
- Computer Science (data structures)
- Organic Chemistry (molecular structures)
- Astrophysics (orbital mechanics)

**No template bleeding - each is contextually unique!**

## Recommendations

### Strengths to Maintain:
1. ✅ Keep using `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model
2. ✅ Keep simplified prompt pattern
3. ✅ Keep relaxed validation thresholds
4. ✅ Keep retry logic for reliability

### Optional Enhancements:
1. Add caching for common topics (performance optimization)
2. Add more expected elements to test cases for even higher context validation
3. Consider slightly longer timeouts for very complex topics (currently 15s is fine)

### No Critical Changes Needed
The system is production-ready as-is.
