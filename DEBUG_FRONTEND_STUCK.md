**Backend emitted ALL 5 steps successfully!**

## FRONTEND STATUS: ‚ùå STUCK

**What user sees:**
- Title rendered
- Circuit diagram visible
- But NOTHING else renders after that

## LIKELY CAUSES:

### 1. Animation Queue Stuck
The SequentialRenderer/AnimationQueue might be:
- Stuck on one operation
- Hit an error and stopped (despite error handling)
- Waiting for a promise that never resolves

### 2. Renderer Error
One of the new renderers we added might:
- Have a bug that stops execution
- Be waiting for something indefinitely
- Crashing silently

### 3. Canvas Layer Issue
The layer accumulation fix might:
- Not be working correctly
- Layers overlapping incorrectly
- Z-index issues

## IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED:

Check browser developer console for:
1. JavaScript errors
2. Renderer warnings
3. AnimationQueue logs
4. Any stuck promises

## QUICK TEST:

Open browser console (F12) and check for:
- Red errors
- "SequentialRenderer" or "AnimationQueue" logs
- Any "Error processing action" messages
