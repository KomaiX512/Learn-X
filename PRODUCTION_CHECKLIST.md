# Production Readiness Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Verification

### 1. Build Verification
```bash
# Backend compiles without errors
cd /home/komail/LEAF/Learn-X/app/backend
npm run build
# Expected: ✓ No TypeScript errors

# Frontend compiles without errors
cd /home/komail/LEAF/Learn-X/app/frontend
npm run build
# Expected: ✓ Vite build successful
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Check .env file
cd /home/komail/LEAF/Learn-X/app/backend
cat .env | grep -E "GEMINI_API_KEY|RATE_LIMIT_RPM|USE_VISUAL_VERSION"
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ `GEMINI_API_KEY=***` (Set and valid)
- ✅ `RATE_LIMIT_RPM=150` (Tier 1 limit)
- ✅ `USE_VISUAL_VERSION=v3` (Production pipeline)

### 3. Transcript Generator Test
```bash
cd /home/komail/LEAF/Learn-X
node test-transcript.js
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ TRANSCRIPT GENERATED SUCCESSFULLY
Length: >200 characters
✅ Conversational: YES
✅ Educational: YES
✅ TEST PASSED
```

### 4. Full System Test

**Start Services**:
```bash
cd /home/komail/LEAF/Learn-X/app
npm run dev
```

**Test Query**: "Teach me Newton's First Law of Motion"

**Expected Backend Logs**:
```

🚀 ABOUT TO EMIT STEP
SessionId: xxx
StepId: 1
Actions: 4
✅ EMITTED SUCCESSFULLY
```

**Expected Frontend Behavior**:
1. ✅ Browser console shows:
   ```
   🎬 FRONTEND RECEIVED RENDERED EVENT
   Actions count: 4
   [App] Transcript received: [text]...
   ```

2. ✅ Canvas displays 4 SVG visuals sequentially

3. ✅ Transcript appears below "Current Step" with 🎙️ icon

4. ✅ Auto-plays without manual intervention

5. ✅ Each of 3 steps renders completely

### 5. Quality Verification

**Visual Quality**:
- [ ] Each visual has animations (`<animate>`, `<animateMotion>`, `<animateTransform>`)
- [ ] Labels are present and readable
- [ ] Context-specific to the topic (not generic)
- [ ] No duplicate/identical visuals

**Transcript Quality**:
- [ ] 2-3 paragraphs in length
- [ ] Conversational tone ("you", "we", "let's")
- [ ] Explains visuals being shown
- [ ] Uses first-principles thinking
- [ ] Engages with psychological hooks

**Performance**:
- [ ] Step generation: 50-70 seconds (acceptable)
- [ ] No timeouts or API failures
- [ ] Memory usage stable (<200MB)
- [ ] Browser responsive during playback

### 6. Error Handling

**Test Failure Scenarios**:

1. **Invalid API Key**:
   ```bash
   # Set invalid key temporarily
   GEMINI_API_KEY=invalid npm run dev
   ```
   Expected: Proper error message, no crash

2. **Network Timeout**:
   - Disconnect network mid-generation
   - Expected: Retry logic triggers, eventually fails gracefully

3. **Malformed Response**:
   - Expected: Auto-repair or clean failure, no frontend crash

### 7. No Fallbacks Verification

**Critical Check**: Ensure NO fallback generation is active

```bash
cd /home/komail/LEAF/Learn-X/app/backend/src
grep -r "fallback" agents/ orchestrator.ts
```

**Expected**: Only comments or error messages, NO active fallback code

### 8. Browser Console Verification

**During Lecture**:
- [ ] No JavaScript errors
- [ ] All socket events received
- [ ] Canvas renders without warnings
- [ ] Transcript displays correctly

**Look for**:
```
✅ Socket joined room successfully
🎬 FRONTEND RECEIVED RENDERED EVENT
[CanvasStage] ✅ Calling sequentialRenderer.processChunk
[SequentialRenderer] 🎬 Processing 4 actions for step 1
```

### 9. Production Metrics

**Track These Values**:
- Average generation time per step: ____ seconds
- Success rate: ____ % (aim for >95%)
- Visual quality (animations present): ____ %
- Transcript quality (2+ paragraphs): ____ %
- API calls per lecture: ____ (should be ~15 for 3 steps)

### 10. Final Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All builds compile without errors
- [ ] Environment variables configured correctly
- [ ] Transcript generator test passes
- [ ] Full lecture completes successfully (3 steps)
- [ ] 4 visuals per step generated
- [ ] Transcript appears for each step
- [ ] Auto-play works by default
- [ ] No fallback generation active
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Performance acceptable (50-70s/step)
- [ ] Quality meets standards (animations, labels, context)
- [ ] Error handling works properly
- [ ] Memory usage stable
- [ ] API rate limits respected
