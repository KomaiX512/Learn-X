# ✅ PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS APPLIED - PROFESSIONAL DIAGRAM BOOST

**Date:** 2025-10-01 17:16 PKT  
**Status:** DEPLOYED - Backend Restarted with Enhanced Prompts  
**Target:** Boost from 32-47 ops to 50-70 ops with section markers and V2 tool priority

---

## 🎯 THREE CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### **Priority 1: Operation Count Boosted** ✅

#### Changes Made:
1. **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS Section Enhanced:**
   ```
   🚨 OPERATION COUNT: Generate EXACTLY 50-70 operations
      - Count your operations as you generate!
      - Less than 50 = AUTOMATIC REJECTION
      - More than 70 = AUTOMATIC REJECTION
      - Aim for 55-60 for safety
   ```

2. **Instructions Updated:**
   - Changed: "SELECT 30-50 operations" → "SELECT 50-70 operations"
   - Added: "COUNT YOUR OPERATIONS: You MUST generate 50-70 total operations!"

3. **Example Updated:**
   - Old example: 9 operations (too short)
   - New example: **55 operations** with detailed multi-section structure

4. **Composition Workflow:**
   - Changed: "Each mini-diagram = 10-15 operations"
   - Kept: 4-5 mini-diagrams × 12-14 ops each = 50-70 total

#### Expected Impact:
- **Before:** 32-47 operations (below target)
- **After:** 50-70 operations (professional quality)
- **Increase:** +40-60% more visual richness

---

### **Priority 2: Section Markers Mandated** ✅

#### Changes Made:
1. **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS Section:**
   ```
   🚨 SECTION MARKERS: Include 4-5 labels with ① ② ③ ④ ⑤ symbols
      - Example: { "op": "drawLabel", "text": "① INPUT STAGE", ... }
      - NO section markers = AUTOMATIC REJECTION
      - These organize your multi-diagram composition
   ```

2. **Composition Workflow Updated:**
   - Added: "**Section Label** (① ② ③ ④ ⑤) - MANDATORY marker" as first item
   - Emphasized: "ADD section marker label at top" of each diagram

3. **Example Enhanced:**
   - Shows 4 section markers: ① INPUT STAGE, ② AMPLIFIER, ③ OUTPUT STAGE, ④ GAIN ANALYSIS
   - Each section clearly organized with marker at top

4. **Quality Standards:**
   - Changed flow: "Title → Concept 1 → Concept 2..."
   - To: "Title → Section ① → Section ② → Section ③ → Section ④ → Summary"

#### Quality Enforcer Enhanced:
```typescript
// New validation in qualityEnforcer.ts
const sectionMarkers = actions.filter(a => {
  if (a.op !== 'drawLabel') return false;
  const text = (a as any).text || '';
  return text.match(/^[①②③④⑤⑥]/);
});

if (sectionMarkers.length < 3) {
  issues.push(`CRITICAL: Only ${sectionMarkers.length} section markers (need 4-5)`);
  score -= 25;
}
```

#### Expected Impact:
- **Before:** 0 section markers (no organization)
- **After:** 4-5 section markers (clear multi-diagram structure)
- **Benefit:** Professional textbook-quality layout

---

### **Priority 3: V2 Operations Prioritized** ✅

#### Changes Made:
1. **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS Section:**
   ```
   🚨 DOMAIN-SPECIFIC OPERATIONS: 60-70% must be V2 tools
      - Calculate: (V2 ops / total ops) × 100 ≥ 60%
      - Use drawCircuitElement NOT drawCircle for circuits
      - Use drawMolecule NOT drawRect for chemistry
      - Generic shapes = LAST RESORT ONLY
   ```

2. **Domain Tool Priority Map Added:**
   ```
   🎯 PRIORITIZE DOMAIN TOOLS:
      - Electrical? → drawCircuitElement, drawSignalWaveform, drawConnection
      - Physics? → drawForceVector, drawPhysicsObject, drawTrajectory
      - Biology? → drawCellStructure, drawOrganSystem, drawMembrane
      - Chemistry? → drawMolecule, drawAtom, drawReaction, drawBond
      - Math? → drawCoordinateSystem, drawGeometry, drawLatex
      - CS? → drawDataStructure, drawNeuralNetwork, drawAlgorithmStep
   ```

3. **Tool Selection Step Enhanced:**
   - Added: "SELECT the most appropriate DOMAIN-SPECIFIC tools (NOT generic shapes!)"
   - Added: "PRIORITIZE domain-specific tools (60-70% of operations MUST be V2 tools)"

4. **What To Avoid Section:**
   ```
   ❌ AVOID GENERIC: drawCircle, drawRect, drawLine (only use if domain tools insufficient)
   ```

5. **Example Improvements:**
   - Old: Mixed generic and domain tools
   - New: 75%+ domain-specific operations (circuits, waveforms, connections)
   - Comment: "// ✅ ~75% domain-specific operations"

#### Expected Impact:
- **Before:** 52-53% domain-specific operations
- **After:** 60-70% domain-specific operations
- **Benefit:** More specialized, topic-appropriate visualizations

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Why These Fixes Work:

1. **Operation Count:**
   - **Problem:** Prompt said "30-50" and Gemini took lower bound
   - **Solution:** Changed to "50-70" with REJECTION warnings
   - **Psychology:** Gemini responds to explicit minimums

2. **Section Markers:**
   - **Problem:** Optional feature → Gemini ignored it
   - **Solution:** Made MANDATORY with REJECTION threat
   - **Psychology:** Clear examples + consequences = compliance

3. **V2 Operations:**
   - **Problem:** Generic tools easier than domain-specific
   - **Solution:** Explicit "DO NOT use generic" + domain mapping
   - **Psychology:** Show exact tool for each domain + negative examples

### Prompt Engineering Principles Applied:

1. **Explicit > Implicit:** "50-70" better than "rich content"
2. **Examples > Descriptions:** 55-operation example better than explaining
3. **Consequences > Suggestions:** "REJECTION" better than "recommended"
4. **Formatting > Plain Text:** 🚨 symbols draw attention
5. **Specificity > Generality:** "Use drawCircuitElement" better than "use appropriate tools"

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### From Previous Test:
- **Discovery:** Old agent was active due to env var
- **Fix:** Changed `USE_VISUAL_V2=true` in .env
- **Lesson:** Always verify runtime configuration

### From Metrics Analysis:
- **Discovery:** Operations below target (32-47 vs 50-70)
- **Root Cause:** Prompt said "30-50" and Gemini conservative
- **Fix:** Changed to "50-70" with REJECTION warnings
- **Lesson:** Be explicit about minimums, not just targets

### From Section Marker Gap:
- **Discovery:** 0 section markers despite being mentioned
- **Root Cause:** Optional feature buried in examples
- **Fix:** Made MANDATORY in CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
- **Lesson:** Optional features get ignored - make critical things mandatory

### From V2 Operation Regression:
- **Discovery:** 52-53% vs old agent's 74-88%
- **Root Cause:** New stricter limits made Gemini cautious
- **Fix:** Explicit domain tool priority + "DO NOT use generic"
- **Lesson:** When adding constraints, explicitly guide toward desired behavior

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT CONFIRMATION

**Backend Status:** ✅ Running on port 3001  
**Agent Active:** ✅ visualAgentV2.ts (confirmed via USE_VISUAL_V2=true)  
**Prompt Version:** ✅ Enhanced with all 3 priority fixes  
**Quality Enforcer:** ✅ Updated with section marker validation  
**Composition Validator:** ✅ Active (from previous deployment)  

**Ready for Testing:** ✅ YES

---

**HONEST ASSESSMENT:**

The enhancements are **DEPLOYED and READY**. All three priority fixes have been implemented with explicit, strict requirements that should force Gemini to comply. The prompt now:

1. **Demands 50-70 operations** with REJECTION warnings
2. **Mandates 4-5 section markers** with examples and penalties
3. **Prioritizes V2 operations** with domain-specific tool mapping

**Next step:** Test with real queries and monitor if Gemini complies with the strengthened requirements. If it still generates below target, we may need to adjust the model temperature or use a different prompting strategy (e.g., few-shot examples at the end).
