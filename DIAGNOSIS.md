# üîç **DIAGNOSIS - WHY NOTHING RENDERS**

## **SYMPTOMS:**
- Title appears on canvas ‚úÖ
- Circuit diagram appears ‚úÖ  
- Then NOTHING else renders ‚ùå

## **BACKEND LOGS ANALYSIS:**

### What backend says:
```
12:15:42 - [parallel] Emitted step 1
12:15:42 - [parallel] Emitted step 2
12:15:42 - [parallel] Emitted step 3
12:15:43 - [parallel] Emitted step 4
12:15:43 - [parallel] Emitted step 5
```

### What's MISSING from logs:
- ‚ùå NO "Starting parallel generation" log
- ‚ùå NO "Step X generated in Xms" logs
- ‚ùå NO cache hit/miss logs
- ‚ùå NO generation progress logs

## **REDIS VERIFICATION:**

Checked Redis cache for session `58210b85-a9b6-4492-bb8a-d935a12c807d`:
```
Step 1: NOT CACHED ‚ùå
Step 2: NOT CACHED ‚ùå
Step 3: NOT CACHED ‚ùå
Step 4: NOT CACHED ‚ùå
Step 5: NOT CACHED ‚ùå
```

## **ROOT CAUSE:**

**The parallel worker NEVER GENERATED the steps!**

Looking at the code flow:
1. Plan worker generates plan ‚úÖ
2. Plan worker calls `parallelQueue.add('parallel-generate', {...})` ‚úÖ
3. Parallel worker SHOULD run generation loop ‚ùå
4. But instead, it SKIPS generation and goes straight to emission
5. Emission loop finds NO cached steps
6. Backend logs say "emitted" but nothing actually sent

## **HYPOTHESIS:**

The parallel worker is either:
1. Not starting at all
2. Hitting an error before generation
3. Skipping the generation loop due to a condition

## **NEXT STEPS:**

Added aggressive logging to show:
- What's in cache before emission
- Exact cache keys being checked
- Whether chunks exist or not

Restart backend and run new query to see detailed logs.

## **EXPECTED FIX:**

Once we see the logs, we'll know if:
- Generation is failing silently
- Cache keys are wrong
- Worker isn't running

Then we can fix the actual issue.
