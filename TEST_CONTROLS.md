## Common Issues & Solutions

### Controls Not Visible
**Check:**

### NEXT Button Always Showing
**Fix:**
- Should only show in Manual mode
- Check mode state in toolbar

### Emojis Still Showing
**Clear cache:**
```bash
# In frontend directory
rm -rf dist node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

### Zoom Not Working
**Check:**
- Console for stage errors
- Stage ref is initialized
- Scale limits (0.3x to 5x)

### Hand Raise Not Working
**Check:**
- Lecture is playing
- Not already in question mode
- Canvas is rendered

## Success Criteria

## Screenshots to Verify

Take screenshots of:

## Performance Check
