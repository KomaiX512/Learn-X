# Interactive Canvas UI - Fixes & Tests Complete ✅

## 🎯 All Critical Issues FIXED

### Issue #1: Toolbar Disappearing on Scroll ✅ FIXED
**Solution**: Changed overlay positioning from `absolute` to `sticky`
- Toolbar now stays at top of viewport
- Hand button always visible
- No scroll interference

### Issue #2: Input Field Not Appearing After Drawing ✅ FIXED  
**Solution**: Added immediate callback trigger in `PenDrawingLayer`
- Input appears instantly after each stroke
- Automatic positioning near drawing
- Auto-focus for immediate typing

### Issue #3: No Multi-Mark Support ✅ FIXED
**Solution**: Added "Mark More" button
- User can add multiple marks
- Input hides but pen stays active
- All marks visible in final screenshot

## 🔍 Known Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)
1. **Touch Support**: Pen drawing optimized for mouse, touch may need tuning
2. **Safari Sticky**: Sticky positioning may behave slightly different
3. **Large Screenshots**: High DPI may cause memory spikes on low-end devices

### Recommended Improvements
- Add undo/redo for drawings
- Support drawing shapes (circles, rectangles)
- Color picker for pen strokes
- Save/load question history
