  "strokeWidth": 1,
  "visualGroup": "main"
}
```

**Verified:**
- ✅ Proper `op` field (not `operation`)
- ✅ Coordinates 0-1 normalized
- ✅ visualGroup field present
- ✅ Valid SVG paths with curves
- ✅ Proper JSON structure

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Deploy to production (ready now)
2. ⏳ Monitor first 24 hours
3. ⏳ Track quality metrics
4. ⏳ Collect user feedback

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Reduce generation time (currently ~9s, target ~5s)
2. Add quality analytics dashboard
3. Implement caching for common topics
4. Add A/B testing for prompt variations

### Monitoring in Production
1. Track operation counts (should stay 40-80)
2. Monitor quality scores (should stay 50+)
3. Watch for fallbacks (should remain 0)
4. Check generation times (should stay <15s)
