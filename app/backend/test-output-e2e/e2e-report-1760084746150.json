Illustrate a network of simple, interconnected nodes, hinting that information flows through them. Ask: 'What if instead of telling a computer *how* to solve this, we just showed it examples and let it *figure out* the rules?' Introduce the idea of a 'black box' that can adapt.",

Connect multiple neurons into layers to form a network, visualizing data flowing forward as sequential decisions. Introduce the concept of a 'cost function' as a way to quantify how 'wrong' the network's output is, and visualize this cost as a landscape or surface that we want to navigate to its lowest point (representing minimal error). Explain 'learning' as iteratively adjusting the 'valves' (weights) to minimize this cost, using the analogy of a ball rolling down a gradient.",

Visualize matrix multiplication for propagating data through layers. Then, meticulously derive backpropagation for a single neuron, explaining the chain rule visually as a 'flow of blame' backward through the network. Illustrate how a small change in a weight influences the final cost by calculating partial derivatives step-by-step for a simple network. Show how the gradient of the cost function with respect to each weight and bias can be computed efficiently, allowing us to update parameters in the direction of steepest descent.",

Introduce different cost functions, particularly Cross-Entropy for classification, and visualize its landscape. Discuss the role of the learning rate and illustrate how too high or too low can hinder convergence on the cost surface. Briefly touch upon vanishing/exploding gradients and how techniques like ReLU or batch normalization mitigate them. Demonstrate the difference between batch and stochastic gradient descent by animating their paths on an error landscape. Introduce momentum and Adam as more sophisticated optimizers, showing how they navigate complex cost surfaces more effectively.",
