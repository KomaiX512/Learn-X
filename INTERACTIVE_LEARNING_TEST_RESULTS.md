## 🎯 Quality Assessment

### Strengths ✅

1. **Context Engineering**: Perfect understanding of question and context
2. **SVG Compliance**: 100% valid, renderable operations
3. **Normalized Coords**: All spatial operations use 0-1 range
4. **Action Count**: Within 10-15 target range
5. **Multimodal**: Successfully processes screenshots
6. **JSON Output**: Clean, parseable response

### Areas for Improvement ⚠️

1. **Visual Ratio**: 58.3% visual ops (target: 80%)
   - More arrows, circles, diagrams needed
   - Less text labels preferred

2. **Response Time**: 28.9 seconds (target: <10s)
   - Acceptable for complex questions
   - Could be optimized with caching

### Recommendations

1. **Prompt Enhancement**: Emphasize visual operations over text
   ```
   "Use 80% visual operations (arrows, circles, graphs)
    and only 20% text labels"
   ```

2. **Temperature Tuning**: Increase from 0.75 to 0.85 for more creativity

3. **Response Caching**: Cache common clarifications to reduce latency
