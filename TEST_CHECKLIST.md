# ✅ **FRONTEND RENDERING - TEST CHECKLIST**

## **Quick Verification Steps**

### **1. Clear Browser Cache** 🔄
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R (Linux/Windows)
       Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

### **2. Check Services Running** 🔍

**Backend:**
```bash
# Should see in terminal:
Server listening on port 3001
WebSocket server listening...
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
# Should see in terminal:
VITE v5.4.20  ready in X ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### **3. Submit Test Query** 📝
```
Query: "teach me newton laws of motions"
Click: "Start Lecture"
```

### **4. Watch For These Indicators** 👀

#### **✅ GOOD SIGNS:**
- [ ] Title appears within 1 second
- [ ] Operations appear **continuously** (no long pauses)

- [ ] Text is **WHITE** and readable
- [ ] Circles/shapes are **BRIGHT** (cyan/green/red/pink)
- [ ] Canvas **scrolls smoothly**
- [ ] All 5 steps render
- [ ] Total time: ~30 seconds
- [ ] No console errors

#### **❌ BAD SIGNS (Should NOT happen):**

- [ ] Takes >60 seconds

### **5. Browser Console Check** 🔧

**Open:** F12 → Console tab

**Should See:**
```
[renderer] Starting step: 1 with 28 actions

[renderer] V2 operation drawConnection
[renderer] Completed step 1 in 5600ms (5.6s)
[renderer] Starting step: 2 with 34 actions

Error: ...
Uncaught ...
Cannot read property...
```

### **6. Visual Quality Check** 🎨

**Colors:**

- [ ] Labels: WHITE text
- [ ] Circuits: BRIGHT CYAN (#00d9ff)
- [ ] Waveforms: BRIGHT RED/PINK (#ff3d71)
- [ ] Connections: BRIGHT GREEN (#00ff88)

**Contrast:**
- [ ] All text clearly readable
- [ ] All shapes clearly visible
- [ ] No black-on-black rendering
- [ ] Professional appearance

### **7. Performance Check** ⚡

**Timing:**
- [ ] First operation: <1 second
- [ ] Per operation: ~0.2 seconds
- [ ] Step 1 complete: ~6 seconds
- [ ] All 5 steps: ~30 seconds

**Smoothness:**
- [ ] No freezing
- [ ] No stuttering
- [ ] Continuous rendering
- [ ] Smooth scrolling

### **8. Content Completeness** 📋

**Operations Rendered:**
- [ ] Titles (5x, one per step)
- [ ] Labels (15-20x with white text)
- [ ] Circuits/Shapes (20-30x in bright colors)
- [ ] Waveforms/Connections (10-20x in bright colors)
- [ ] Animations (particles/orbits/etc if present)

**Total Operations:** Should be ~140-160 across all 5 steps

## **🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Issue: Canvas Freezes After 2-3 Operations**

**Cause:** Old cached JavaScript  
**Fix:**
```bash
1. Hard reload: Ctrl+Shift+R
2. Clear cache: F12 → Application → Clear Storage
3. Close all browser tabs
4. Reopen: http://localhost:5173
```

### **Issue: Text Still Dark/Invisible**

**Cause:** Color fix not applied or cached  
**Fix:**
```bash
# Rebuild frontend
cd /home/komail/LeaF/app/frontend
npm run build

# Hard reload browser
Ctrl+Shift+R
```

### **Issue: V2 Operations Not Rendering**

**Check Console:**
```javascript
// Should see:
"V2 operation drawCircuitElement"
"V2 operation drawConnection"

// If you see:
"V2 operation X received but not yet implemented"
→ Operation has placeholder (green circle)
→ This is NORMAL for unimplemented ops
```

### **Issue: "DomainRenderers" Import Error**

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check file exists
ls -l /home/komail/LeaF/app/frontend/src/renderer/DomainRenderers.ts

# Rebuild
cd /home/komail/LeaF/app/frontend
npm run build

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### **Issue: Takes Too Long (>60 seconds)**

**Check:**
1. Network tab: WebSocket connected?
2. Backend logs: All 5 steps emitted?
3. Console: Any errors?

**Most Likely:** Old code cached

**Fix:** Hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)
