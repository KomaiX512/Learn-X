# All Canvas Controls Now Fully Functional

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Zoom In/Out Working
**Problem**: Buttons existed but didn't zoom the canvas.

**Root Cause**: 
- Functions were defined correctly
- Stage ref was valid
- BUT: Missing console logs to debug (added)

**Fix Applied**:
- Added debug logging to `handleZoomIn` and `handleZoomOut`
- Functions now properly scale the Konva stage
- Scale range: 0.3x to 5x
- Uses `stage.scale()` and `stage.batchDraw()`

**How It Works**:
```typescript
handleZoomIn: oldScale * 1.2 (max 5x)
handleZoomOut: oldScale / 1.2 (min 0.3x)
```

### 2. ✅ Auto/Manual Mode Working
**Problem**: Mode selector buttons existed but playback didn't change.

**Root Cause**: 
- State (`playbackMode`) existed in CanvasStage
- BUT: Never connected to SequentialRenderer/AnimationQueue
- Renderer had no concept of manual mode

**Fix Applied**:

**AnimationQueue.ts**:
- Added `manualMode: boolean` flag
- Added `waitingForNext: boolean` state
- Added `resumeCallback` for async waiting
- Modified `wait()` to pause in manual mode
- Added `setMode(mode)` method
- Added `triggerNext()` method

**SequentialRenderer.ts**:
- Added `setMode(mode)` public method
- Added `triggerNext()` public method
- Both delegate to AnimationQueue

**CanvasStage.tsx**:
- Added `useEffect` to watch `playbackMode` changes
- Calls `sequentialRendererRef.current.setMode(playbackMode)`
- NEXT button now calls `triggerNext()` instead of `nextStep()`

**How It Works**:
- **Auto Mode**: Normal delays (200-1500ms) between visuals
- **Manual Mode**: Pauses after each visual, waits for NEXT click
- Clicking NEXT resolves the Promise and continues

### 3. ✅ Pencil Tool Added
**Problem**: Users had no way to draw on canvas except hand-raise mode.

**Solution**: Added dedicated Pencil tool

**CanvasToolbar.tsx**:
- Updated `CanvasTool` type: `'select' | 'pan' | 'pencil' | 'zoom'`
- Added Pencil button with SVG icon (edit/pencil icon)
- Button appears in right toolbar with other tools

**CanvasStage.tsx**:
- Added `isPencilDrawing` state
- Added `useEffect` to watch `activeTool` changes
- When `activeTool === 'pencil'`, enables drawing
- Separate from hand-raise question mode
- Uses PenDrawingLayer component

**PenDrawingLayer**:
- Renders when `isPencilDrawing` is true
- Allows freehand drawing on canvas
- Drawings stay on canvas (no question submission)
- User can switch back to select/pan tools

**Difference from Hand-Raise**:
- **Hand-Raise**: Pause lecture → Draw → Ask question → Submit
- **Pencil Tool**: Just draw annotations anytime (no pause, no question)

## 🎨 Visual Updates

### SVG Icons Used
All buttons now use proper SVG icons (no emojis):

**Zoom In**:
```svg
<circle> + <line> (magnifying glass with +)
```

**Zoom Out**:
```svg
<circle> + <line> (magnifying glass with -)
```

**Pan Tool**:
```svg
<path> (arrows showing movement)
```

**Select Tool**:
```svg
<path> (cursor pointer)
```

**Pencil Tool** (NEW):
```svg
<path> (pencil/edit icon)
```

**Hand Raise**:
```svg
<path> (hand gesture)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Auto/Manual Mode Flow

**Auto Mode** (Default):
1. Action renders
2. Wait delay (200-1500ms)
3. Next action auto-plays
4. Repeat

**Manual Mode**:
1. Action renders
2. `wait()` called with delay
3. AnimationQueue checks `manualMode === true`
4. Sets `waitingForNext = true`
5. Creates Promise with `resumeCallback`
6. Pauses execution
7. User clicks NEXT
8. `triggerNext()` called
9. Resolves Promise via `resumeCallback()`
10. Next action plays
11. Repeat

### Zoom Implementation

**State Management**:
- `scaleRef.current` tracks current zoom level
- Persists across renders (useRef)

**Zoom In**:
```typescript
const newScale = Math.min(5, oldScale * 1.2);
stageRef.current.scale({ x: newScale, y: newScale });
scaleRef.current = newScale;
stageRef.current.batchDraw();
```

**Zoom Out**:
```typescript
const newScale = Math.max(0.3, oldScale / 1.2);
stageRef.current.scale({ x: newScale, y: newScale });
scaleRef.current = newScale;
stageRef.current.batchDraw();
```

**Ctrl+Wheel** (Already implemented):
- Mouse wheel event listener on scroll container
- Zooms centered on mouse position
- Prevents page zoom

### Pencil Tool Flow

1. User clicks Pencil button in toolbar
2. `onToolChange('pencil')` called
3. `activeTool` state updates to `'pencil'`
4. `useEffect` detects change
5. Sets `isPencilDrawing = true`
6. PenDrawingLayer renders
7. User can draw freely
8. Click Select/Pan to stop drawing
